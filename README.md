# Avrae
List of my avrae aliases and snippets that I have created. They can be subcribed to [here](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/60caddc495cccad933c3daca). While the code has been put up here in case it might be helpful for others learning Draconic please do not steal this and claim the aliases as your own. Thanks!
